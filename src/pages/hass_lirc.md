  <h3>Using lirc on home assistant OS</h3>

Hello,

So I have an argon one v2 case, the one with the ir reciever, and I would really like to intergrate that into my home assistant setup (Rpi4 on hassOS), however I can see no way to do that. If there is some really obvious thing that I'm missing, then please drop me a line on [jacob@omg.lol](mailto:jacob@omg.lol).

Thank you for your time,
Jacob
